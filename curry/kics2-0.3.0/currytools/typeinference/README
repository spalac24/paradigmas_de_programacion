Type Inference for FlatCurry
============================

This directory contains the implementation of a type
inferencer for FlatCurry programs which annotates
each expression occurring in a FlatCurry program with its
actual type.

It can be used by any other Curry program which processes
or transforms FlatCurry programs. The main operation to use is

    Inference.inferProg :: Prog -> IO (Either String (AProg TypeExpr))

which annotates a FlatCurry program with type information.
