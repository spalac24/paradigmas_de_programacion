Completed
=========
- Anonymous free variables implemented
- hierarchically structured modules
- Records: There is no way to explicitly import a record with its fields:
    import CompilerOpts                -- okay, works
    import CompilerOpts (Options)      -- okay, but no field labels imported
    import CompilerOpts (Options (..)) -- fails: Options is not a data type
- Checked correctness of created FlatCurry files by comparison with the old
  frontend

Still to do
===========
- Module pragmas
- type classes
- option to disable nondeterminism by overlapping
- option/check for case mode
- FFI for C (Haskell?)
- Extend error messages of the type checker (and maybe others, too)
  with the origin of the inferred types in case of a type conflict
