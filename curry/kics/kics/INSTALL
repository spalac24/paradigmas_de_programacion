To install KiCS on your system, follow this procedure:

1. Make sure that you have a fairly new and functional version of the 
   Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC>=6.8.2) installed. 
   To check your installation, type:

      $ ghc --version

   and you should get something like:

      The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.8.2

   Note that the place of the ghc binary has to be included in your
   current search path prior to building kics.

2. The KiCS system is divided in two parts: a frontend and a backend. 
   If you should happen to have the PAKCS system installed, 
   you only need to install the KiCS backend. 
   Simply set a path to the PAKCS frontend, e.g., for bash type:

      $ export PATH=your_path_to_pakcs/mccparser/bin:$PATH

   If you need to install the frontend, download the source tarball at
   http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~bbr/download/frontend.tgz 
   Unpack and make it, e.g.:

      $ gunzip frontend.tgz
      $ tar xf frontend.tar
      $ cd mccparser
      $ make

   Afterwards you have to set a path to the newly created binary, e.g.:

      $ export PATH=path_to_where_you_unpacked_tarfile/mccparser/bin:$PATH

   You can check the frontend by

      $ which cymake

   And you should see something like

      /home/bbr/mccparser/bin/cymake

3. Now install the backend. 
   This file is already part of the source tarball originally from
   http://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~bbr/download/kics_src.tgz
   Unpack the tar ball and make it, e.g.:

      $ gunzip kics_src.tgz
      $ tar xf kics_src.tar
      $ cd kics
      $ make

4. If you want to use the b.i.o. debugger you have to type additionally:

      make bio
