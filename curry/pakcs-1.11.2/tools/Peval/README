This is a partial evaluator for Curry implemented in Curry
by Elvira Albert, German Vidal (UPV), and Michael Hanus (CAU Kiel)

This version is integrated in PAKCS as follows:

* After loading some program into PAKCS/curry2prolog, this
  program can be partially evaluated by the command ":peval".

* The expressions to be partially evaluated must be marked in the
  program by (PEVAL ...) where PEVAL is the identity function
  (defined in the standard prelude).

* The marked expressions are partially evaluated and replaced by
  their partially evaluated versions. This modified program is
  stored in "<prog>_pe.flc" provided that <prog> is the name
  of the source program.

* The partially evaluated program "<prog>_pe.flc" is automatically
  loaded into PAKCS. Although there is no Curry source file for this
  program, the (decompiled) source can be viewed by the command ":show"
  (if you are interested to see the result of the partial evaluation).


If you want to run this version stand-alone (i.e., independent from PAKCS),
you can partially evaluate program <prog>.curry by the shell command
"./execpeval <prog>".
