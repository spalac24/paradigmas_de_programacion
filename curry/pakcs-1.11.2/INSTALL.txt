PAKCS: The Portland Aachen Kiel Curry System
============================================

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

The current version of PAKCS runs on Unix-based platforms
and has been tested under SunOS, Linux, and Mac OS X.
If you want to install and run the complete system
on your computer, you need the following software:

* [SICStus-Prolog](http://www.sics.se/sicstus.html)
  (Version 3 #5 or higher) (recommended)
* [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org)
  (if you do not have SICStus-Prolog, but then the execution is less
  efficient and some functionality (e.g., constraint solvers) is
  not available)

How to generate and install the PAKCS kernel:
---------------------------------------------

1. Go into the main directory of PAKCS (which contains
   this file). In the following, we assume that `pakcshome`
   is the name of this directory.
2. If you have the executables `sicstus` (for SICStus-Prolog)
   or `swipl` (for SWI-Prolog) in your path,
   execute "`make`" which installs PAKCS
   (after asking you to confirm the values for the
   environment variables `SICSTUSDIR` or `SWIPROLOG`).
   These values are stored in the home directory in file
   `.pakcsinitrc` so that they are available for future installations
   of new versions of PAKCS.
3. Otherwise, modify in the shell script "`pakcshome/pakcsinitrc`"
   the definition of the variables `SICSTUSDIR` or `SWIPROLOG`
   according to your local installation.
   If both variables are undefined, the PAKCS compiler system
   is not installed (i.e., only the front-end is installed).
4. If you install PAKCS from the source code distribution, you need also the
   [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
   (i.e., the executable "`ghc`" must be in your path)
   to compile the front end of PAKCS.
   If you do this for the first time, you need to install
   some Haskell packages via Cabal, i.e., run the command

       make installhaskell

5. Now, install PAKCS by "`make`" (if you have already an older
   installation of PAKCS, do "`make clean`" before).
6. Add the directory "`pakcshome/bin`" to your path, e.g., by the command

       export PATH=$PATH:pakcshome/bin

   in the `bash`.
   If you do no want to have the specific version number of PAKCS
   included in your path, you can set a symbolic link like

       ln -s pakcs-<version> pakcs

   and put the directory <code>pakcs/bin</code> into your path.
   Now you can start the PAKCS compiler system via the command "`pakcs`".
7. If you want, you can also execute "`make libdoc`"
   to generate a local version of the documentation of all system libraries
   by the CurryDoc tool into the directory "`pakcshome/lib/CDOC`".
   However, this is only necessary if you want to work offline since
   you can also access the documentation online at
   <http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~pakcs/lib/>.
8. You can configure the behavior of PAKCS by various setting
   in a "pakcsrc" file. For doing so, copy the file
   `pakcshome/pakcsrc.default` as "`.pakcsrc`"
   (which will be automatically done when you start PAKCS for the first time)
   into you home directory and modify the settings.
9. If you like to have support for _line editing or history functionality_
   in the PAKCS interactive environment (as supported by the readline
   library), you should have the Unix/Linux command "`rlwrap`" installed
   on your local machine. PAKCS uses "`rlwrap`" if called on a terminal
   without the parameter "`--noreadline`".

How to install additional packages:
-----------------------------------

The distribution of PAKCS contains various additional packages
and libraries. Some require additional software packages that are
described below.

1. If you want to use the **library for GUI programming in Curry**
   (`pakcshome/lib/GUI.curry`), you need also a
   Tcl/Tk implementation (including the windowing shell `wish`)
   which can be downloaded
   [here](http://www.scriptics.com/software/tcltk/)
   In this case, the windowing shell `wish` must be
   in your path (or you can also modify the definition of the
   function `openWish` in the library `GUI.curry`).
2. If you want to use the **DaVinci library for the visualization of graphs**
   (`pakcshome/lib/DaVinci.curry`), you need also an
   installed daVinci system which can be downloaded
   [here](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~davinci/).
   In this case, you have to modify the definition of the constant
   `dvHome` in the library `pakcshome/lib/DaVinci.curry`
   according to the installation path of daVinci.

Changing system constants:
--------------------------

The distribution of PAKCS is configured with a
**maximal tuple arity of 15**, i.e., Curry programs containing larger
tuple sizes cannot be compiled. If you want to increase this size
(usually, it is preferable to change your program), you have to change
(in a source distribution of PAKCS)
two system files and install your system as follows:

1. Change the definition of the constant `maxTupleArity` in the files
   `pakcshome/frontend/curry-frontend/src/Generators/GenFlatCurry.hs`
   and `pakcshome/curry2prolog/compiler.pl`
   according to your required maximal arity.
2. Delete the file `pakcshome/lib/Prelude.fcy`.
3. Re-install PAKCS by `make`.

Hints for specific platforms
----------------------------

### Ubuntu 7.10

If you install PAKCS from the binary Linux distribution,
the pre-compiled executable of the front-end might not find
the library `libgmp.so.3`. This problem can be fixed
by the following commands (executed as root):

    cd /usr/lib 
    ln -s libgmp.so.3.4.1 libgmp.so.3 

If you use SWI-Prolog, you should install the packages
`swi-prolog` as well as `swi-prolog-clib`
from the Ubuntu distribution.
The latter package is necessary if sockets, ports, and
other system-oriented features should be used in Curry.

(Thanks to Sergio Antoy and Steffen Mazanek for these hints.)
