This directory contains a collection of (mainly small) example
programs for Curry and PAKCS. An index and a short description of
most of these programs are contained in the file "index.html".

Further useful files:

CPTEST: a shell script to test the curry2prolog system.
        In order to test the system after some modifications,
        do the following steps:

           ./CPTEST > xxx
           # if you use SICStus Prolog:
           diff CPTEST.sicstusresult xxx
           # or if you use SWI Prolog:
           diff CPTEST.swiresult xxx

        If the output of "diff" is empty, you are lucky:
        the old examples are still working!


CJTEST: a shell script to test the curry2java system.
        In order to test the system after some modifications,
        do the following steps:

           ./CJTEST > xxx
           diff CJTEST.result xxx

        Note: even if the modifications are working, there will
        be some differences due to other run times and different
	orders of solutions (remind that the curry2java system
	is an OR-parallel implementations, i.e., the order of
	solutions depends on the Java scheduler).


TCTEST: a shell script to test the tastecurry system.
        In order to test the system after some modifications,
        do the following steps:

           ./TCTEST > xxx
           diff TCTEST.result xxx

        Note: even if the modifications are working, there might
        be some differences due to new variable numbers or similar
        things.
