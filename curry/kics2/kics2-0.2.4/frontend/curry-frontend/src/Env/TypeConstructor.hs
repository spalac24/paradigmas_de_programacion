    For all defined types the compiler must maintain kind information. At
    present, Curry does not support type classes. Therefore its type
    language is first order and the only information that must be recorded
    is the arity of each type. For algebraic data types and renaming types
    the compiler also records all data constructors belonging to that
    type, for alias types the type expression to be expanded is saved. In
    order to manage the import and export of types, the names of the
    original definitions are also recorded. On import two types are
    considered equal if their original names match.

    The information for a data constructor comprises the number of
    existentially quantified type variables and the list of the argument
    types. Note that renaming type constructors have only one type
    argument.

    Importing and exporting algebraic data types and renaming types is
    complicated by the fact that the constructors of the type may be
    (partially) hidden in the interface. This facilitates the definition
    of abstract data types. An abstract type is always represented as a
    data type without constructors in the interface regardless of whether
    it is defined as a data type or as a renaming type. When only some
    constructors of a data type are hidden, those constructors are
    replaced by underscores in the interface. Furthermore, if the
    right-most constructors of a data type are hidden, they are not
    exported at all in order to make the interface more stable against
    changes which are private to the module.
