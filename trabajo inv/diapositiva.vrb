  This same principe may also be extended to handle non-deterministic operations and extra variables, by simply examining every possible or branch, and not requiring that all the rules are confluent to the same normal form. For example, the rule

\begin{verbatim}
x ? _ = x
_ ? y = y
\end{verbatim}

  Gives two results for \verb|0 ? 1|, namely \verb|0| and \verb|1|.
